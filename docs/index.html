		Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).

### Developing a skill requires

* Amazon Developer Account
* Amazon Console Account
 * Or some way to deploy web service
* Alexa enabled device (e.g. a Dot)
 * Can be Reverb on Phone


---


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/BabyGrootCookie01.jpg" -->
### So, a Developer gets a Dot

#### Alexa/Amazon overview
---
* ASK (Skills Kit) and AVS (Voice Service)
* Echo, Tap, Dot
* [Developer.amazon.com](developer.amazon.com)
* [AWS.amazon.com](aws.amazon.com)


--


<img height="350px" src="images/alexa-family.jpg" />


---


### Intents and Utterances

* Go to Developer account, Alexa tab, ASK
* Create a skill (Small Business site - ACME, Inc.)


--


<img src="images/ask.jpeg" />


--


<img src="images/skills.jpeg" />


--

* Invocation Name
* Must Define your "intents"
* Define "utterances" that are the phrases to match to intents
* Alexa, ask [or tell] {invocation name} [for] {intent}
* Alexa, ask 'Small Biz' for General Information


--


<img src="images/name.jpeg" />


--


<img src="images/intent.jpeg" />


---


### Provide a service
---
* Yes, finally getting to the serverless part
* You can create your own web service to handle the ASK JSON request/response
* But, the point for my talk is to use this as an opportunity to try lambda services
* Recommend that you go ahead and get started doing things manually


--


<img src="images/lambda.jpeg" />


---


### Point to the service
---
* Now, that you have a service, go back to the developer tab
* Copy in the ARN for your lambda


--


<img src="images/arn.jpeg" />


---


### Test
---
#### Three ways to test


--


* From the developer Console
 * Can examine the JSON in and out!
<img src="images/dev-test.jpeg" />


--


* From the AWS lambda console
 * You'll likely end up there anyway if your skill fails
 * Examine cloud watch logs (simple errors prevent JSON return)
 * Either use the test config Alexa JSON or use the input JSON from developer


--


<img src="images/lambda-test.jpeg" />


--


* From your device
 * Your skill is immediately available to your account
 * If you don't have a device, use reverb or [echoism.io](https://echoism.io)




---


#### Basic Example, "Tech Em" (techem branch)
##### Copy and paste deployment
---
* This is the actual code for a basic published skill
* There is a convention for alexa github projects
 * Copy speechAssets/intents.json into your intents
 * Copy speechAssets/utterances.txt into your utterances
 * Copy speechAssets/{slot_type}.txt into your custom slot type (explained later)
 * Copy src/index.[py,js] into your lambda function


--


* So, essentially have three tabs open: developer, aws console, and github
* git speech Assets -> developer

<img src="images/git-intent.jpeg" />


--


* git src -> lambda
* This example simply "hard codes" the responses
<img src="images/techem.jpeg" />


---


<!-- .slide: data-background="#ff0000" -->
### Have a skill running in minutes
---
* Use any of the many examples at https://github.com/alexa
* When creating a lambda funcion, you can use an alexa blueprint that matches the github repo and have a skill in 5 minutes!
* Great walkthrough for Node - Fact Skill: https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-fact - updated with new skill builder
* Or use my https://github.com/alexa_python techem branch for Python


---


### Enhanced teaching Example
---
* Still need to copy and paste speechAssets to developer
* But, let's make the lambda deployment a little better
* While also simplifying the code if you have a new Python developer
* Hello travis-ci


--


* On the master branch, we have separated functions
* One basic Python function per intent
* Focus on simple intent/response skill
* Now that we have two Python files, we would have to zip and upload
* We leverage Travis to do that!

<img src="images/travis.jpg" />


--


<img src="images/my_py.jpeg" />


--


* Push to master and travis deploys
* Add a function to add an intent to the service 
* Still need to sync with the intent schema
<img src="images/travis-yml.jpeg" />


---


### Persist some data
#### S3 branch
---
* Ok, that was still hard coding, so let's use a data file
* We'll use a JSON file in S3, source in reponses directory
* We'll deploy the lambda and the S3 Together
* And, sneaking in a "slot"


--


* Slots are like parameters for your skills
* Alexa, Ask Small Biz who is {employee}
<img src="images/slot.jpeg" />


--


* In most situations, one would name the slot something meaningful, like employee
* However, this lambda can be reused for any intents and slots based on JSON convention
* Thus, we still have to keep intents, utterances, and now custom slot types in sync with the service
* Keeping in the same project helps
* Can update by deploying new S3 from local, or updating the S3 directly in your bucket


--


<img src="images/s3.jpeg" />


--


<img src="images/travis-s3.jpeg" />


---


### S3 to Dynamo
#### dynamo branch
---
* Ok, let's put this in a db.
* Everything is pretty dynamic, so once deployed, can keep intents and slots in sync between developer and dynamo db


--


<img src="images/dynamo.jpeg" />	


---


### Build a Service
---
* Now, suppose you start building out some REST services in front of your db
* You can leverage Travis to deploy the same code to two different lambda functions
* One is triggered by API Gateway and the other is triggered by ASK
* Simple interrogation of the lambda_handler event to decipher ASK JSON vs. API JSON



--


### Deploy Together
---
* So, you can ensure your code is in sync.
* Can use custom CRUD or even use the python dyanamo blueprint


--


<img src="images/topics.jpeg" />


--

<img src="images/d-blueprint.jpeg" />


---


### As projects get bigger
---
* Can separate CRUD Service
* Reuse API access layer
* Deploy to PyPi to be reused on devices or test environments
 * We use PyPi as a means to deploy to Raspberry Pis
 * Can help with independent black box testing

<img src="images/pypi.jpg" />

## And Wait!
### What about Node/JS?
### What about Serverless.com
---
* Have focused on Alexa, Py and Travis
 * Yes, a bit manual/clear box
* So, Check out serverless.com
* Very easily deploy Node lambda
* And deploy API GW (endpoint)


--


* Can also deploy python code with serverless
* There are many ways to enjoy your cookie, e.g.:
 * Deploy to Alexa lambda and pypi via Travis
 * Reuse pypi module via serverless for API
* If you get serious, try out your own (and let me know)
* And don't forget the testing!!
* And there is also handling of ASK session for deep dialogues
* We are adding a deep decision tree example driven by dynamo which heavily leverages session
* And, just have fun with it!!

---


### Some parting thoughts
---
* Have fun and use alexa skills as the carrot on a stick to learn more severless
* Build a service on Azure called by ASK
* And don't discount this new world of VUI
* Thinking through new skills by starting with your vision for the dialogue is a new and exciting design problem
* And go ahead and publish skills! Check out the Amazon developer site for more info on swag you can get for publishing!
